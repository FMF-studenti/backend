# How to contribute?

## Submitting Issues

Found a bug on [FMF.si](http://fmf.si)? Here are some guidelines on how to
report the issue so it can be resolved it as fast as possible:

- Think if it is server or interface issue. For latter, report issues
  [here](https://github.com/FMF-studenti/frontend/issues).
- Explain in detail how to reproduce the issue.
- Include your browser and operating system.
- If developing, describe your development environment.


## Feature Requests

Feel free to open an issue describing your needed functionality. If you can,
you are encouraged to write the new features by yourself and submit a pull
request (more details below).


### Pull Requests

To ease the pull request merge into mainline, please follow these requirements:

- The pull request title and message should be meaningful enough that reading
  the code is not necessary.
- Use similar coding style as you see (or will see) in existing code, notably:

  - use 4 spaces indentation not tabs
  - try to document all functions, classes and the code that is not obvious

- **One pull request per feature**. If you want to do more than one thing, send
  multiple pull requests. You should create a separate branch for each one.
- Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful.
  If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please
  squash them before sending them to us.
- Use git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
feature to tidy up your commits before submitting the pull request.
